# Zotero-to-Obsidian-Quick-Copy
I modified a translator by Scott Campbell and Avram Lyon to generate a markdown link to the library item using my preferred quick reference style AutohorYear. 
For Installation put the js file into the Zotero translators directory (Default: "C:/users/<your name>/Zotero/translators") and select “Zotero to Obsidian” as your quick export style in preferences>export.
